# FLIPEEL

## Computer Science Project 2020-21

FLIPEEL is a simple application that compares the prices ,delivery charges and other conditions related to a particular product available on two of the leading online shopping websites in India namely Flipkart and Snapdeal.

It uses python as the serving language. The popular tool ie web-scrapping is the major concept behind this.

Web-scrapping is simply scrapping or extracting data from web pages. The search engine Google is all about web scrapping.

Here web-scrapping is done via the python library BeautifulSoup (BS4). Another intercative but slower library for web-scrapping is Selenium.

The application requires to be fed URLs(from flipkart and snapdeal only) for product-data scrapping.

## Future Goals

The program will also be equipped with a feature of notifying
the client via email about a price dip(from budget set by client) or a offer on the targetted prodcut.

A database will also be added to the project to store user data
